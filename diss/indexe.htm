          In his speech at the Global Summit of Production and Industrialization (GMIS-2019), the President of the Kurchatov Institute M. Kovalchuk
          noted the strategic importance of nature-like technologies, which, by copying natural processes, not only do not damage
          the ecosystem, but open unlimited prospects for humanity in terms of improving health, longevity and
          quality of life, [<a href="#diss-lit" class="diss-link">1</a>]. The widespread introduction of technologies and systems
          that reproduce the principles of wildlife will allow humanity to switch
          to more economical and safe principles of consumption of natural
          resources. This is exactly what President of the Russian Federation Vladimir
          Putin said in his speech at the 70th session of the UN General Assembly
          on September 28, 2015, [<a href="#diss-lit" class="diss-link">2</a>]. "... We need qualitatively different approaches. The speech should
          to talk about the introduction of fundamentally new nature-like technologies,
          which do not cause damage to the surrounding world, but exist with it in
          harmony and will allow to restore the balance disturbed by a person between
          biosphere and technosphere... We propose to convene under the auspices of the UN a special
          a forum where you can comprehensively look at the problems associated with
          depletion of natural resources, habitat destruction, climate change
          climate..." The concept of widespread adoption of nature-like technologies is not
          it may not concern theoretical and applied materials science, in
          particular regarding the question of the origin of matter. The study and,
          especially, the reproduction in real conditions of the mechanisms of formation
          and the transmutation of material particles will allow humanity to switch to
          more economical and safe principles of natural resources consumption

          Any technology is the result and function of energy.
          Other types of energy, which replaced the muscular, gave rise to the first beginnings of labor mechanization and became the basis for a sharp increase in labor productivity and a reduction in the cost of production. This process was greatly enhanced by the development of processes for the utilization of steam energy from the chemical anergy of organic fuels, which led to the first industrial revolution and determined the triumph of the chain process of the emergence and improvement of technologies, including energy. <br>
          As a result, at the end of the XIX century, the electric power industry arose, its development inevitably led to the appearance of nuclear energy in the middle of the XX century, where a new thermonuclear energy is already maturing in its depths.
          The basis of modern and promising technology is energy, which is based on specific electrical processes, devices, aggregates, apparatuses and equipment.

          In the modern view, matter is a complex system,
          including, in addition to clusters of corpuscles such as atoms and molecules,
          plasma. A simplified diagram of this system is shown in figure 1.

          A generally accepted cosmological model describing the initial stage
          the development of the universe, based on the theory of the "Big Bang" - the moment
          transformations of singularity пїЅ points with minimum size,
          infinite density and temperature, [<a href="#diss-lit" class="diss-link">3</a>]. Its main theoretical
          the provisions allow us to predict the occurrence of corpuscular
          matter as a result of the synthesis of elements of an ideal plasma consisting of
          mainly from elementary particles пїЅ protons, neutrons and
          electrons. As a synthesis mechanism , we can consider
          the following events. As a result of chaotic movement and random
          collisions, protons and neutrons due to the forces of gravity form
          the Daytons . The latter serve as the source material for creating (jointly
          with similar particles) of more complex constructions with different
          the ratio of participants who represent potential
          atomic nuclei having a positive charge equal to the number of
          protons. The latter, interacting with electrons, form ions,
          which, when balancing the positive charge of the nucleus and the electron
          shells become neutral atoms. With a significant volume
          plasma and the high content of free corpuscles in it, fundamentally
          formation of not only atoms of known chemical elements is possible,
          but also the whole gamut of their isotopes with different stability. When
          they decay, new active objects appear.
        </p>
        <p class="maintext__text">
          Under certain conditions , fluctuations of the same type occur in the plasma
          atoms that combine into molecules or form clusters. As a result, the plasma turns into a gaseous, and then into a liquid medium and
          solid body. The same substance can be in the states,
          differing from each other in their mechanical and physical properties. Such states are called aggregate. There are three main
          aggregate states: solid, liquid and gaseous. Examples
          The aggregate states of hydrogen oxide are: ice, water and water vapor.
          The fourth basic aggregate state of matter is considered to be plasma.
          This is the name of a highly ionized, electrically neutral gas with a high relative concentration of charged particles. The plasma is
          the most common state of matter in the universe, since of
          it consists of most of the stars. In addition to plasma , there are
          such specific states of matter as a neutron liquid (from it
          neutron stars consist) and degenerate plasma (consisting of
          completely ionized nuclei and electrons). These states occur
          at ultrahigh pressures and temperatures. Currently accepted
          distinguish the following types of transmutation of chemical elements and substances: synthesis of new substances in living organisms (in biosphere objects) and synthesis
          new substances in non-living environments, such as the hydrosphere, lithosphere and
          technosphere in all its diversity. If in the biosphere, hydrosphere and
          in the lithosphere , synthesis occurs solely as a result of chemical
          interactions of contacting corpuscles of different activity, then in
          in the technosphere, this process is controlled by a person, selecting the appropriate
          participants-reagents and setting the conditions for their contact. Decisive
          a factor in the organization of synthesis is the energy management of the participants
          and the choice of ways to realize their energy capabilities. If in
          in the hydrosphere , dissociation of corpuscles with the help of
          polar structures (ions, molecules, radicals), and the lithosphere
          it is limited to thermal exposure and high pressures, resorting to
          occasionally to the services of catalysts, then in the technosphere a person uses,
          in addition to these factors, the energy of the electric field and decay
          isotope molecules, the energy of artificially accelerated particles, creating
          conditions close to the conditions of the "Big Bang". As examples
          it can be noted that the transmutation of elements was detected during the explosion
          foils, wires, incandescent filaments, in the working chambers of engines
          internal combustion and rocket launchers, when irradiating metal targets with high-energy beams of charged or neutral
          particles. In contrast to thermonuclear fusion, with cold nuclear
          synthesis, decomposition or synthesis of a substance can be stopped artificially,
          because the active particles outside the EMF immediately turn into helium atoms, and
          protons пїЅ in molecular hydrogen, water or peroxides, workers
          temperatures on average do not exceed 1000 <sup>0</sup>пїЅ. In general, nuclear
          synthesis (low-energy transmutation of chemical elements) consists in the nature of EMF (electromagnetic field). An EMF having one
          and the same nature with the electromagnetic forces of Coulomb resistance
          in the nuclei of atoms, changes the vector of these forces directed equally
          in all directions from the core, towards the movement of the EMF, - in these conditions
          protons accelerated in this field are given the opportunity to freely
          penetrate into the nuclei of target atoms and already inside these nuclei
          to influence with your energy the short-acting forces of attraction
          between the particles that make up the nucleus. This can be a half-life, in which the number of protons increases and the number of neutrons decreases in
          the nucleus пїЅ thereby changing the atomic number, that is, a new one is obtained
          a chemical element with new qualities. And this is nuclear fusion,
          [<a href="#diss-lit" class="diss-link">4</a>]. The classification of methods for the synthesis of chemical elements is presented
